# competitive-coding

For Starting into Competitive Programming first you have to setup the files correctly...

It depends on your Text editor what you are using... Sublime Text, VS Code, Atom etc

Sublime Text is my choice for easy and fast setup.

Taking inputs form input.txt and putting output in output.txt

Setting up these file will save you from the sufferings you may face without them.
